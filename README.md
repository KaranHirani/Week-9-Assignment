# Week-9-Assignment

Time spent: **9** hours spent in total

> Objective: Setup a honeypot and intercept some attempted attacks in the wild.

## Which Honeypot(s) you deployed:

For this assignment I used Dionna over HTTP, as specified in the assignment page.  I just used that one Honeypot for the assignment page


## Any issues you encountered:

My biggest issues were installing and getting the Honeypot set up.  The instructions were not very clear and took a while to get the system up and running.  Also, I was getting a page not found error when I had the site up and tried to navigate.  Google cloud services also wouldn't work without credit card information.  Another issue I had was getting permissions for the virtual machine, which I thought I had, but was not working properly.
